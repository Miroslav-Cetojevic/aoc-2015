# [Advent of Code 2015](https://adventofcode.com/2015)

Compiled on Linux with C++17.

Note: I altered some puzzle inputs for ease of use inside the code.

All solutions have been written with the following compiler/flags:

Compiler: GCC (9.2 at the time of writing, 11th December 2019)

Compiler flags: `-std=c++17 -Wall -Wextra -Wpedantic -fsanitize=address,undefined`

Linker flags: `-fsanitize=address,undefined`
